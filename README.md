# GameCube-Banners-for-Wii-USB-Loaders
A collection of custom animated WAD/Banner files I created for displaying GameCube games in USB Loader GX

## Overview
This repo contains animated (with sound) Gamecube Game Banners for use in USB Loader GX. Designed to work in 4:3 and 16:9 ratios.
I've tried to stick to largely official art assets where possible to create a feeling of if these were released officially.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/LinkToTheAsh/GameCube-Banners-for-Wii-USB-Loaders/releases)
1. Insert your SD card into you computer, and navigate to: "SD:/apps/usbloader_gx/cache_bnr". 
2. Once your in this location copy your .bnr files for your region (currently only PAL and NTSC-U) to this folder. 
3. If it asks you to overwrite an existing file just click yes. All thats going to do is replace replace the old banner with the new one.
4. Eject your SD card, and insert it into your Wii. Once you've done that, open USB Loader GX, and you should see the new banners.

## Customization
1. A Template folder has been provided, you are free to modify and use this as you wish and to add new games not added here.
2. All PNG files can be modified as you wish, however its best to leave their canvas dimensions the same especially for the "gameLogo.png"
3. CustomiseMii can be used to create new game banners.
4. If you do create new banners for missing games please drop me a message so I can merge them with the main repo! 

## Disclaimer
WADs are provided on this repo for you to view and modify. They have not been tested in anyway on actual Wii hardware and should not be installed on your console via WAD manager. I accept no responsibilty for bricked Wiis!
